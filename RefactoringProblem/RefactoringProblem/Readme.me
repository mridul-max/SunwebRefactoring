Refactor the Accommodation Report Printer so that it reflects object oriented principles and design patterns.
It should be possible to add another type of accommodation without the need to modify the printer.
The tests may be modified, but not the expected results, these should remain as is.

Bonus points 1: An implementation that can also print a HTML report (in addition to the refactored text report printer).
Bonus points 2: All text should be translatable.
